For Week 8 I had to complete an Apache Lab and a DHCP Help Desk Ticket

Apache Lab Objectives: 

Manual configuration of ip address
Install httpd
Configure httpd
Join web01 to the domain

Security Tip: CentOS and other Redhat based Linux servers ship with SSH turned on.  
This combined with a known "root" user who is able to attempt login remotely presents a security flaw that must be addressed by the systems administrator 
before the system is accessible over the internet.  
The typical solution involves explicitly preventing root from logging in via the sshd_config file.

For the installing apache you need to add ports 80/tcp & 443/tcp or the HTTP and HTTPS defined services to your firewall.
To remove the welcome page you need to open /var/www/html/ 

Commands to install:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

After successful installation we used php.

Then we added your machine to the realm list 

realmd: The ability to easily join a Linux system to a Windows Active Directory Domain is a huge win for centralized account management and security.  
We are going to join our web01 server to yourname.local domain.

sudo yum install realmd samba samba-common oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir sssd

Join the domain: realm join --user=your-domain-admin-username@yourdomain.local yourdomain.local
realm list

To install DHCP for windows I followed the steps provided by: https://blog.eldernode.com/install-and-configure-dhcp-server/
