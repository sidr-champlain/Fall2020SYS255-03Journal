For week 3 I completed a Linux Lab

Goal:

It is very rare that you will find an enterprise that is either fully Windows, Mac or Linux. 
You will likely find a heterogeneous environment where many different operating systems are leveraged to accomplish the organization's mission.  
In this lab today you will configure an operating system called CentOS.  This particular operating system is open source and has been pre-built for you.  
Your job will be to complete the configuration steps to make it useful and manageable in our growing enterprise.

Step 1:

I had to setup the Centos Server. I had to fix the network settings to fit my other machines.
Once I did that, I had to create a new privileged user.

To do that you have to do the following (In root user):

adduser username
passwd username
gpasswd -a username wheel

Extra Tip: Managing Users with Sudo Privileges using the following command:
sudo lid -g wheel
The output will show the users on the network and server.

I ran a few network tests to confirm I connected everything correctly.

Then from my windows machine I used ssh to remote into my linux machine.

Side Note: Systems Administrators will typically manage linux systems remotely via SSH (Secure Shell).  
An application called PuTTY is popular for this purpose and can be optionally installed.  
Fortunately, Windows 10 now ships with an SSH client.

After I connected through ssh, I wanted to get used to some of the commands. A few include:
- pwd
- cd /home
- ls
- ls -1
- mkdr
- yum install
- sudo install
- groups
- history | head -n 10
- cat .bash_history
