Lab02 - Server 2019, ADDS and DNS

 Goal:
 Any sizable environment needs a Domain Name Server (DNS) so that you don't need to manually associate IP addresses with hostnames.  
 In Windows environments, you will often find that the DNS Server and a directory lookup service called active directory are combined on one platform.  
 We will configure such a system on a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine that provides domain name and active directory services for the 10.0.5.0/24 network.
 

I first configured the Server. To do that I first went to the virtual machine hardware settings. 
Then I changed the network to Lan instead of WAN. This allowed me to set the: 

IP Address
Netmask 
Gateway
DNS 

Then I changed my computer name. After this I rebooted to insure that the settings were saved.

I ran a simple network command to confirm the network connectin was solid.

 Commands We used:
 - Whoami
 - Hostname 
 - ping 
 - nslookup
 
 Then I moved onto the ADDS - Active Directory Domain Services
 That was easier to install. I didn't run into an issues. 
 
 After installation, I needed to configure the server to be the primary domain controller for my domain (yourname.local).  
 There was a link to Promote this server to a domain controller.  
 Make absolutely sure you have set the hostname before moving forward with promoting this system.
 
 Once I finshed that, I got a DNS Error because we gave our environment a .local top level domain(TLD), an error is indicated during installation.  
 Valid top level domains are domains like .com, .gov, .edu, .net.  
 Because this is an internal domain, I will left it as is.  
 The naming of local domains is the subject of many debates among systems administrators.
 
 
 
 I fixed this and then installed DNS Record and Reverse DNS.
 Then I was able to successfully add my user to Active Directory
