The lab mentioned a default gateway a couple times.  What is that and why is it important?

Default Gateway is is a term for a hardware node or point that will provide outgoing access to data packets to a destination in some other discrete network(Techopedia)

Errors during the lab:

Adding an Admin Group. I wasn't allowed to add the admin group.
Login Credentials were messed up. 
VM took a long time to set up.

Most interesting part:

Being able to successfuly ping one machine from the other. It took a long time to get this working, and when I solved the issue it felt rewarding.
